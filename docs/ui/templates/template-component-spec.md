- `SubComponent1` (e.g., "Used for the component's title")

### Responsive Behavior

- Detail how elements adapt (e.g., typography scales, elements stack on mobile).


## 3. Actions and Interactions

This section defines the component's specific behaviors.

### [Descriptive Action Name]

#### Trigger
- Describe the specific user action (e.g., "User clicks the 'Close' icon") or prop change that initiates this behavior.

1. Describe the first step of the interaction (e.g., "The `onClose` callback is fired.").
2. Describe subsequent steps, including internal state changes or visual feedback.

#### Emitted Events
- List any callbacks or events that are triggered by this action (e.g., `onClose`, `onSubmit`).


## 4. Data Requirements (Optional)

- **Empty State:** Describe the condition and what is displayed when there is no data (e.g., "The list shows a 'No items' message.").
